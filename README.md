# Salary Trends (Multiclass Classification)

A Python-based machine learning project to classify Data Science salary categories using structured data. Focuses on data exploration, class balancing, and model optimization to support accurate multiclass prediction.

---

## ðŸ“Š Data Exploration & Analysis

- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to explore patterns and relationships in salary data across multiple classes.  
- Identified key features influencing salary classification to inform model development and business insights.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Data Validation & Preprocessing

- Applied **SMOTE oversampling** to address class imbalance and ensure reliable model training.  
- Preprocessed and transformed features to support model readiness and performance.

---

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning & Model Optimization

- Built and compared multiclass classification models including **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** to predict salary categories.
- Tuned hyperparameters using **Grid Search and Randomized Search** to improve model accuracy.
- Evaluated model performance using **ROC-AUC and F1-Score** across all classes to ensure robustness and reliability.
